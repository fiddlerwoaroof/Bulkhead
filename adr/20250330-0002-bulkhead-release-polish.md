# ADR 0002: Bulkhead Release Polish

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2024-03-30

## Context
Bulkhead has reached a level of functionality where a release is viable. The application provides core container and image management features, with proper UI patterns for focus management, keyboard navigation, and search. However, several areas need polish and refinement before release to ensure quality, maintainability, and a positive user experience.

This ADR outlines a plan to address identified issues and prioritize tasks for the Bulkhead 1.0 release.

## Decision
We will focus on three key areas to polish Bulkhead for release:

1. **Code Architecture Improvements** - Refining separation of concerns, improving error handling, and addressing technical debt
2. **UI/UX Refinements** - Ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience
3. **Documentation and Testing** - Providing adequate documentation and ensuring stability

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Code Architecture Improvements

#### 1.1. DockerManager Refactoring
The DockerManager class is currently part of DockerExecutor.swift, which violates separation of concerns. We will extract DockerManager to its own file to improve maintainability and clarify responsibilities.

#### 1.2. Error Handling Enhancement
Current error handling is basic, with simple error messages and limited recovery options. We will improve this by:
- Creating a more comprehensive error type system
- Providing user-friendly error messages with recovery options
- Adding consistent error reporting throughout the UI

#### 1.3. Type Safety Improvements
Remove force-unwrapping where possible and improve optional handling to reduce the risk of runtime crashes.

### 2. UI/UX Refinements

#### 2.1. Visual Feedback Enhancements
Improve visual feedback for actions, particularly for operations like container start/stop, to provide clear indication of success or failure.

#### 2.2. Keyboard Navigation Completion
Finalize and test keyboard navigation, particularly ensuring consistent focus behavior across tabs and between the search field and list items.

#### 2.3. Help Overlay
Add a simple help overlay to explain available keyboard shortcuts and actions.

### 3. Documentation and Testing

#### 3.1. User Documentation
Create basic documentation explaining how to use Bulkhead's core features.

#### 3.2. Developer Documentation
Ensure code is properly documented, especially for complex components like ListView and DockerExecutor.

#### 3.3. Testing
Perform comprehensive testing across different Docker environments (Colima, Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop) to ensure compatibility.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved code maintainability through better separation of concerns
- Enhanced user experience with better error handling and visual feedback
- Reduced risk of runtime issues by improving type safety
- Better onboarding experience through documentation and help overlay

### Negative
- Delay of some planned features in favor of polishing existing functionality
- Potential regression risk when refactoring existing code

### Neutral
- Some technical debt remains to be addressed post-release

## Implementation Checklist

### Code Architecture Improvements
- [x] **DockerManager Refactoring**
  - [x] Create new file DockerManager.swift in the Docker directory
  - [x] Move DockerManager class from DockerExecutor.swift to DockerManager.swift
  - [x] Ensure proper imports and references are updated
  - [x] Test functionality after the move

- [ ] **Error Handling Enhancement**
  - [ ] Expand DockerError enum with more specific error cases
  - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages for each error case
  - [ ] Implement error recovery suggestions where applicable
  - [ ] Create a reusable ErrorView component for consistent error display
  - [ ] Update UI components to use the new error display approach

- [ ] **Type Safety Improvements**
  - [ ] Review and eliminate force unwrapping (!) where possible
  - [ ] Implement proper nil handling with optionals
  - [ ] Add appropriate assertions and preconditions for debugging
  - [ ] Use more specific types instead of generic dictionaries where feasible

### UI/UX Refinements
- [ ] **Visual Feedback Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add loading indicators for container start/stop operations
  - [ ] Implement success/failure feedback for actions
  - [ ] Improve state transitions in the UI when container states change
  - [ ] Ensure color scheme consistently indicates state (running, stopped, etc.)

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation Completion**
  - [ ] Test Tab key navigation throughout the app
  - [ ] Verify Enter key behavior in all contexts
  - [ ] Ensure ESC key properly dismisses or clears as expected
  - [ ] Confirm arrow key behavior for navigation
  - [ ] Test focus persistence when switching tabs

- [ ] **Help Overlay**
  - [ ] Design simple help overlay UI
  - [ ] Implement keyboard shortcut (?) to display the overlay
  - [ ] Document all keyboard shortcuts in the overlay
  - [ ] Group shortcuts logically by function

### Documentation and Testing
- [ ] **User Documentation**
  - [ ] Write basic "Getting Started" guide
  - [ ] Document connection configuration
  - [ ] Create overview of container management features
  - [ ] Document image browsing capabilities
  - [ ] Explain filesystem browser usage
  - [ ] Detail log viewing functionality

- [ ] **Developer Documentation**
  - [ ] Add documentation headers to key classes
  - [ ] Document complex methods, especially in DockerExecutor
  - [ ] Update README.md with development setup instructions
  - [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test with Colima
  - [ ] Test with Docker Desktop
  - [ ] Test with Rancher Desktop
  - [ ] Verify with both arm64 and x86_64 architectures
  - [ ] Test with a variety of containers (different images, states)
  - [ ] Test with large numbers of containers and images
  - [ ] Perform memory usage monitoring during extended use

### Final Release Preparation
- [ ] Update version number in project settings
- [ ] Create GitHub release with release notes
- [ ] Generate DMG or installer package
- [ ] Verify code signing and notarization
- [ ] Prepare App Store submission materials (if applicable)
