*** TODO Refactor List Fetch Error Handling [0%]
    - [ ] Currently, DockerManager holds list-specific errors (containerListError, imageListError), violating SoC.
    - [ ] Move list fetching logic (calling manager.fetchX) and error handling into ContainerListView/ImageListView, likely using local @StateObject ViewModels.
    - [ ] DockerManager should only provide fetch methods and potentially a general status, not UI-specific list error states.
